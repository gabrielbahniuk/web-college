# web-college

A really simple college portal using JSP, where the teachers can set students scores, frequency  and so on.

### How to run

- Run the project over an Apache 8.5 (preference) server + MySQL 5.7 database.
- In the browser, open http://localhost:8080/web-college/projeto/CriaBD.jsp and set the database configuration there.
- After configuring the database, you will be redirected to http://localhost:8080/web-college/projeto/Login.jsp where you can find a list of generated users and passwords (for students and teachers self-related in the database).
- Use them to login and enjoy!
