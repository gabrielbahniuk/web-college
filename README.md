# web-college

A really simple college portal using JSP.

#### What teachers can do

- Set scores and frequency for their students.
- Get the classes and subjects they teach for.

#### What students can do

- See if they're approved or reproved based on their frequency + scores set by the teachers.
- List all subjects they're part of.

### How to run

- Run the project over an Apache 8.5 (preference) server + MySQL 5.7 database.
- In the browser, open http://localhost:8080/web-college/projeto/CriaBD.jsp and set the database configuration there.
- After configuring the database, you will be redirected to http://localhost:8080/web-college/projeto/Login.jsp where you can find a list of generated users and passwords (for students and teachers self-related in the database).
- Use them to login and enjoy!
